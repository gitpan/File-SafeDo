NAME
    File::SafeDO -- safer do file for perl

SYNOPSIS
      use File::SafeDO qw(
            DO
      );

      $rv = DO($file,[optional no warnings string])

DESCRIPTION
    * $rv = DO($file,[optional] "no warnings string");
        This is a fancy 'do file'. It first checks that the file exists and
        is readable, then does a 'do file' to pull the variables and
        subroutines into the current name space. The 'do' is executed with
        full perl warnings so that syntax and construct errors are reported
        to STDERR. A string of no warnings may optionally be specified as a
        second argument. This is equivalent to saying:

          no warnings qw(string of no values);

        See: man perllexwarnings for a full listing of warning names.

          input:        file/path/name,
                    [optional] string of "no" warnings
          returns:      last value in file
                    or  undef on error
                    prints warning

          i.e. DO('myfile','once redefine');

        This will execute 'myfile' safely and suppress 'once' and 'redefine'
        warnings to STDERR.
