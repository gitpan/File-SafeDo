	the DO process with an optional command switch.

0.10  Mon Mar 14 20:48:03 PST 2005
	Revision number 0.06 was and OOPS! number wise.
	The revision level in the file was actually 0.03
	sigh.... so I've upped it to 0.10

	The "do $file" function in the previous revision
	called the 'do' function in the scope of THIS package
	when what we really want is the scope of the 'caller' 
	package. This release corrects this defect with an
	eval that executes a "do $file" in the scope of the
	caller by inserting an anonymous subroutine into
	the calling package.
	
was really 0.03
0.06  Tue Mar  12 12:42:10 PST 2004
	initial release

	adapteded from Net::DNSBL::Utilities v0.02
